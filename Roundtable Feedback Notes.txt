making my own backgrounds to simplify the mechanics - creating the characters as objects

using collages instead of having to coding everything by myself

ladyk notes:

work with found images and scan them - p5 play library

	- focus on whats happening when rather than focusing when its happening

	- barnes and nobles collage, impose these collages

	- getting those things with the p5 library, choose whether you want to do 1 or 2

- you can add program things above

- checkpoints : shade are off it , playing with the opacity and stuff

- question: what are tasks?

- cone: online game - random stuff - kinda interesting

- if you go with 1 or 3, there's a hint of narrative - encourage how much of the narrative you want to get into - how deep you want to get out

- flesh out the tasks you want people to do

- milestone: get started with the p5.play and scanning the objects into the game
