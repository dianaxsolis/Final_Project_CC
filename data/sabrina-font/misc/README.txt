sabrina_.tff is a true type font for your pc. it should work on 3.1 and up.
although maybe not 98. 
sabrina.sui should be in a mac format, and should work on all versions? i 
dont have a mac so who knows?

email me if you have any questions - thepimp@vulgar.net

although i am no computer expert so if it doesnt install i might
have no clue at all how to help you.
